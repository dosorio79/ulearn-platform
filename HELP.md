## What this app is
This app creates a single 15-minute lesson on demand. It focuses on data and Python topics and keeps the scope small so you can get a clear takeaway quickly. Each lesson is self-contained and designed for one sitting. The system is stateless: it does not track your history, save progress, or personalize lessons across sessions.

## How a lesson works (step-by-step)
1. Enter a topic and choose a difficulty level.
2. Click “Generate lesson” to request a new lesson.
3. Review the lesson in order: objective, example, then exercise.
4. Run the code blocks, copy the markdown, or export the lesson if you want to keep it.
5. Start a new lesson whenever you are ready.

## Running Python code
Code blocks include a Run button. When you click it, the code executes locally in your browser using a lightweight Python runtime. The first run may take a moment while the runtime loads. Output appears beneath the code block. Execution is sandboxed: it does not access your files or the network, and long-running jobs may be interrupted. You can edit Python snippets to fix small issues or experiment, and use Reset to restore the original generated code.

## AI-generated content
Lesson text and code are generated by an AI model. Treat the content as a draft or study aid, not authoritative guidance. You should verify details, especially for production use, and expect occasional mistakes or omissions.

## Exports (Markdown / Jupyter)
You can copy lesson content as Markdown or download it as a `.md` file. You can also export a `.ipynb` notebook for use in Jupyter. Exports always reflect the original generated lesson content, not any edits you make in the browser. Exports do not update automatically.

## Experimental features and limitations
The platform is intentionally minimal and optimized for short sessions. Topics that are too broad may feel compressed. Python execution is limited to what can run in the browser, so some libraries or heavy workloads may not be available. Demo mode may return static lessons rather than generating new ones.
