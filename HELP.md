## What this app is
- Generates a single **15-minute lesson** on demand  
- Focused on **Python and data** topics  
- **Self-contained**, designed for one sitting  
- **Stateless**: no history, progress tracking, or personalization  

## How a lesson works
1. Enter a topic and choose a difficulty level  
2. Click **Generate lesson**  
3. Review the lesson in order: objective → example → exercise  
4. Run code, copy Markdown, or export the lesson  
5. Start a new lesson when ready  

## Running Python code
- Each code block has a **Run** button  
- Code executes **locally in your browser**  
- First run may take a moment while the runtime loads  
- Output appears below the code block  
- Python blocks are editable for quick fixes; use **Reset** to restore the original snippet  

**Notes**
- Execution is sandboxed (no file or network access)
- Long-running jobs may be interrupted  

## AI-generated content
- Lessons are generated by an AI model  
- Treat content as a **study aid**, not authoritative guidance  
- Verify details before production use  
- Occasional mistakes or omissions are expected  

## Exports
- Copy lesson content as **Markdown**
- Download lessons as `.md` or `.ipynb`
- Exports reflect the lesson at generation time  
- Exports use the original generated lesson content, not local edits  

## Limitations
- Broad topics may feel compressed  
- Browser-based Python limits available libraries  
- Demo mode may return static lessons
