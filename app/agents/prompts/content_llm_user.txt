Create a 15-minute lesson on "{topic}".

Sections:
{sections_desc}

Rules:
- You MUST generate content for ALL sections listed above.
- You MUST NOT add, remove, rename, or reorder sections.
- Use section ids exactly as provided.
- Return blocks with type: text | python | exercise.
- At least one python block is required.
- Python blocks must be independently runnable.
- Python blocks must include all required imports.
- Python blocks must produce visible output using print(...).
- Total minutes must remain unchanged.
- Return a JSON object with a top-level "sections" array only.

Performance guidance:
- Prefer deterministic, reproducible examples.
- Do NOT use random, time, timeit, or wall-clock timing.
- Explain performance using structural reasoning, vectorization,
  memory usage, data types (e.g., categoricals), or algorithmic differences.
- If an example would normally rely on timing or randomness,
  replace it with a fixed, hard-coded example and explain
  why it scales better conceptually.

Exercise block rules:
- Exercise content must be returned as a block with type "exercise".
- Exercise blocks must contain plain text only.
- Do not use markdown fences or inline markers for exercises.
- Do NOT include :::exercise or ::: markers in exercise content.
- Example (correct):
  "blocks": [{{"type": "exercise", "content": "Convert the column to categorical and explain the speedup."}}]

Required sections (reference):
- id: concept, minutes: 5
- id: example, minutes: 6
- id: exercise, minutes: 4

Output schema:
{{
  "sections": [
    {{
      "id": "concept",
      "title": "Core concept",
      "minutes": 5,
      "blocks": [
        {{"type": "text", "content": "..."}},
        {{"type": "python", "content": "..."}}
      ]
    }}
  ]
}}

Return JSON only.
